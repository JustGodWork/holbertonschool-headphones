# Overview

This project is a responsive web page based on a Figma design. The goal is to implement the design's visual elements and interactions, ensuring the page adapts to various screen sizes and meets the specified user interaction behaviors.

## Project Details:

- Figma File:
    [Link to Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/design/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company) (Make sure you duplicate the file to your drafts for access to all design elements.)

- Fonts Used:
    - [Source Sans Pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro)
    - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)

## Features

- Responsive Design:
    The layout switches to a mobile-friendly version when the screen width is 480px or less.

- Max Width:
    The content is centered with a maximum width of 1000px for optimal readability on larger screens.

- Hover/Active States: Links:
    Change color to #FF6565 when hovered or active.
- Buttons:
    Hover and active states have opacity: 0.9 to provide subtle feedback.

## Installation

## Usage

- Open the index.html file in your browser.
- Resize the window to see the layout adapt to different screen widths, particularly below 480px.
- Interact with the buttons and links to observe their hover and active states.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5:
    For structure and content.
- CSS3:
    For styling and responsive design.
